## `:communication`

* Architectural layer: **Domain**
* Abstractness: **Abstract**

> Communication-related components, like _Client_, _Server_, _Encoder_ and so on.
> 
> They can be treated as data sources, just like _Repositories_, since they are abstract and depend only on models from [`:communication:models`](https://github.com/mmolosay/DataLayerCommunication/tree/master/communication/models) and other stable components.
